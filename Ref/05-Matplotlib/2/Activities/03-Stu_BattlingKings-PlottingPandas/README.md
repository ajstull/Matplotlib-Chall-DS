# Battling Kings

In this activity, you will create a bar chart that visualizes which kings within the Game of Thrones universe have participated in the most battles.

## Instructions

* Your task is to plot the total number of battles each king in the Game of Thrones dataset participated in. In other words, you need to determine how many times each king started a battle and how many times each was a defender. See below:

    * Use Pandas to load the `got.csv` dataset.

    * Create a series containing the number of times each king was an attacker.

    * Create a series containing the number of times each king was a defender.

    * Combine these two variables into a single series. (Hint: How should you combine these two series? Can you add series in Pandas?)

    * Use your combined data to retrieve labels for your x-axis ticks.

    * Create a bar chart with red bars and set its x-axis tick labels appropriately.

    * Add a title and labels to your plot.

    * Display your plot. Which king participated in the most battles? The least?
