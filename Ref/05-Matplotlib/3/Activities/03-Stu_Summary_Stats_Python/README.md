# Summary Statistics in Python

In this activity, you will be tasked with calculating a number of summary statistics using California housing data.

## Instructions

* Using Pandas, import the California housing dataset from the Resources folder.

* Determine the most appropriate measure of central tendency to describe the population. Calculate this value.

* Use both data visualization and a quantitative measurement to find whether the age of houses in California is considered normally distributed.

* Inspect the average occupancy of housing in California and determine if there are any potential outliers in the dataset.

* If there are potential outliers in the average occupancy, find the minimum and maximum of the median housing prices across the outliers.

## Bonus

Plot the latitude and longitude of the California housing data using Matplotlib and color the data points using the median income of the block. Does any location seem to be an outlier?

## Hint

* This dataset is very large.
